Progress:
Completed work building operators as per instructions in document.
Implemented Queue structure to hold states to be explored, needed for A* search.
Begun work to search for all ways to move clear blocks in a given state.

Needs to be done: 
create heuristic and count steps taken so far for a given state. 

I couldn't really follow Jacob's code. It's mostly one big function that should be split into something more readable and approachable so that we can all contribute. 

I see I've been "assigned" the task of writing an outline. This will be difficult without us being on the same page with what's happening in our implementation. 

Since we're citing references in our report, we should consult our sources and get inspiration from them before implementing.
